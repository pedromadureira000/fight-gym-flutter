# Sign the app
To publish on the Play Store, you need to sign your app with a digital certificate.

Android uses two signing keys: upload and app signing.

Developers upload an .aab or .apk file signed with an upload key to the Play Store.
The end-users download the .apk file signed with an app signing key.

# Create an upload keystore
https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/android
`
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/upload-keystore.jks -keyalg RSA \
        -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias uploadkey
`
* update info on android/app/build.gradle : android.signingConfigs.release

# Update SHA-1 signing certificate fingerprint 
* run it
`
./gradlew signingReport
`
* copy the SHA1 from the correct variant "release" or "debug" and update on Google api services > credentias > OAuth 2.0 Client IDs

# Optimizations
* reduce size: https://medium.com/@panuj330/pushing-flutter-to-the-limit-the-ultimate-guide-to-reducing-flutter-app-size-4eb05c4351d1
- use `--web-renderer html` and delete CanvasKit folder (if it's still generated)

# Firebase auth with google
